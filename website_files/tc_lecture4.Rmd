## Introduction
<!-- Original graphic is on pg 18 of Adi's Lecture 3 -->

In Prof. Wyner's lectures, you saw a graph of Earned Run Average (ERA) against year. 
Also shown was a line connecting the average ERA in each year.

In order to reproduce this image, we will work with the [Lahman Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-database.html).
As it turns out, there is an R package that includes the entire database (up until the 2018 season).
We will load that into R along with the `tidyverse` packages when we begin our analysis. 

## The Lahman Baseball Database
<!-- Short description of the Lahman database can go here. We have to convert things to a tibble, using as_tibble(). -->

As mentioned above, we will use data from a baseball data maintained by [Sean Lahman](http://www.seanlahman.com).
This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics from Major League Baseball from 1871 to 2018 (most recent fully completed season). 
The data is available as an R package, which we will need to install and load.
To install the package, we need to run the following in our console
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("Lahman")
```

Once the package is installed, we can load it into R along with the `tidyverse` packages:
```{r load-lahman}
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
```

We will focus on pitching statistics today.
To load the pitching data into R from the `Lahman` package, we have to use the `data()` function.
We also will need to *convert* the data into a `tibble`. 
```{r load-pitching}
Pitching <- as_tibble(Pitching)
```

There are tons of rows and columns in the dataset.
For this exercise, we will only want to focus on ERA and also focus only on those pitchers who have pitched at least 150 innings. Unfortunately, the Lahman pitching dataset does not contain the number of innings pitched (IP). Instead, it has a column called `IPouts`, which is the number of outs pitched and with the formula of $\text{IPOuts} = 3 \times \text{IP}.$

Using what we covered in previous lectures, we will create a new tibble called `pitching` which contains all players who pitched at least 150 innings, played in either the AL or the NL and which contains only the columns corresponding the player, year, team, league, innings pitched, and ERA.

```{r pitching, tidy = FALSE}
pitching <- Pitching %>%
  mutate(IP = IPouts / 3) %>% 
  filter(lgID %in% c('AL', 'NL') & IP >= 150) %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, lgID, IP, ERA)
pitching
```

**IMPORTANT**: Before reading any further, make sure you and your team understand completely what is happening in the code above.

Now that we have ERA for all pitchers eligible for our analysis, we can plot the ERAs by year. Feel free to experiment with different ways of presenting this information via the different visualizations we covered in [Lecture 3](tc_lecture3.html).
```{r, tidy= FALSE}
ggplot(data = pitching) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = yearID, y = ERA), size = 0.3)
```

Looking at the plot, it appears that some of the pitchers from the first few decades of baseball had the lowest ERA. Using `arrange()`, we can see which pitcher had the best season according to ERA. 

```{r}
arrange(pitching, ERA)
```
It would appear that the best pitching season of all time was [Dutch Leonard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Leonard_(left-handed_pitcher)) 1914 season with the Red Sox.
The next best was [Mordecai Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Brown)'s 1906 season with the Cubs.
How much better was Leonard's 0.96 ERA than Brown's 1.04 ERA?

To answer this, we can transform ERA to standardized units using the `mutate()` function. 
There is a minor complication: there is not a built-in function for standardizing a variable in R!
Luckily for us, R allows us to define our own functions like so:
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
standardize <- function(x) {
  mu <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  sigma <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return((x - mu) / sigma)
}
```
For now, don't worry too much about the syntax or the `na.rm = TRUE` bits - that's just
telling R to remove any missing values when computing the average and standard deviation (easy way to deal with messy data). Armed with our `standardize()` function, we can add a column called `z_era_all` which transforms ERA to the standardized scale.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
pitching <- pitching %>%
  mutate(z_era_all = standardize(ERA))
pitching %>% arrange(z_era_all)
```

Now we see that Leonard's 0.96 ERA was about 3 standard deviations below the overall mean of qualified pitchers, while Brown's was about 2.91 standard deviations below the mean!
On the other hand, the ostensibly worst pitching season was Philadelphia's own [Les Sweetland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Sweetland) in 1930.
Incidentally enough, Sweetland started that season with a three-hit shutout!
Check out this [ESPN blog post](http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/48687/the-amazing-1930-philadelphia-phillies) about the 1930's Phillies pitching staff.

Of course, you can argue that comparing the raw ERAs across the various years is unfair.
After all, the game as it was played in 1914 is very different to the one played today! 
As such, it may be more appropriate to standardize all of the ERAs **within each season** separately. 
To do this, we will have to compute the mean and standard deviation of ERAs within each season.

## Grouped calculations

Very often in a data analysis, instead of performing a calculation on the entire data set, you'll want to first *split* the data into smaller subsets, *apply* the same calculation on every subset, and then *combine* the results from each subset. For example, in order to replicate the figure above from Prof. Wyner's lecture, we need to split our pitching dataset based on the year, compute the average ERA within each year, and then combine these into a single tibble.

One strength of dplyr is the ease with which you can follow this "split-apply-combine" paradigm using the function `group_by()`.
We can use this in concert with the pipe as follows
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
pitching <- pitching %>% 
  group_by(yearID)
```

When we print out `pitching` now, we notice an extra line that tells us the grouping variable. Now when we pass this dataset on to subsequent calculations, these calculations will be done on each group. 

We can now summarize each season using another `tidyverse` function called... `summarize()`! This convenient function will compute summary statistics that we specify with respect to the groups from `group_by()`. For instance, we can compute the average ERA in each year in the following way:
```{r year-ave, tidy = FALSE}
pitching %>%
  summarize(ave_ERA = mean(ERA))
```

The following functions are quite useful for summarizing several aspects of the distribution of the variables in our dataset:

* Center: `mean()`, `median()`
* Spread: `sd()`, `IQR()`
* Range: `min()`, `max()`
* Count: `n()`, `n_distinct()`

We'll now create a dataset, `pitching_summary`, that contains the mean and standard deviation of ERA **within each year**:
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
pitching_summary <- pitching %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(ERA), 
            sd = sd(ERA))
```

One of the most commonly used functions, `n()`, returns counts and is especially useful when used on a grouped dataset We can, for instance, count the number of pitchers in our dataset within each year using `n()`.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
pitching %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(count)
```

Or equivalently, we can use the `count` function:

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
pitching %>% 
  count() %>%
  arrange(n)
```

What's the difference between the two approaches above?

**Exercise**: Describe, in words, what the following code does.
```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
pitching %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count >= 90) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

Once we add a grouping to our dataset, it also changes the way `mutate()` operates on it.
We can now standardize each pitcher's ERA within each year and store that result in a column called z_era_year
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
pitching <- pitching %>%
  mutate(z_era_year = standardize(ERA))
pitching %>% arrange(z_era_year)
```

### Ungrouping and grouping on multiple variables

As we just saw, when we add a grouping to a dataset, it affects how verbs like `summarize()` and `mutate()` operate on our data. It is sometimes the case that we wish to remove the grouping and let these verbs (and others) operate on the entire dataset again.
To remove the grouping, we have to use the `ungroup()` function.
Remember, as with the other `tidyverse` verbs we've learned, we need to store the result if we want the dataset to remain ungrouped!

```{r ungroup, tidy = FALSE}
pitching <- pitching %>%
  ungroup()
```

To verify that we've indeed removed the grouping, let's re-run the code from above to compute the mean and standard deviation of ERA.
```{r verify-ungroup}
pitching %>% summarize(mean = mean(ERA), sd = sd(ERA))
```

Up to this point, we have only grouped on a single variable. It is sometimes desirable to group on multiple variables at once. For instance, we may want to standardize ERA not only within each year but also within each leauge (AL and NL). That is, we may want to standardize each individual pitcher's ERA using only the data from the other pitchers who pitched in the same league and in the same season. We also add a column called `count_year_lg` to record the number of pitchers included in each year-league combination.

```{r multiple-grouping, tidy = FALSE}
pitching <- pitching %>%
  group_by(yearID, lgID) %>%
  mutate(z_era_year_lg = standardize(ERA),
         count = n())
```
When we arrange by the ERA standardized within the year and league, we now see that Pedro Martinez's 1999 and 2000 season with the Red Sox were even better than Dutch Leonard's 1914 season! 

```{r pedro-arrange, tidy = FALSE}
pitching %>%
  arrange(z_era_year_lg)
```

As a final note, when we group by multiple variables, the order in which we specify the variables in `group_by()` matters.

## Back to the figure

We started this module with a figure similar to one from Professor Wyner's class that plotted ERAs over time.
When we run the following code, we get a plot that's very similar to the desired one but that is missing the red line showing the average ERA within each season. 
```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(pitching) +
  geom_point(aes(x = yearID, y = ERA), size = 0.3)
```

To *add* this to our plot, we need to simply re-run the code above but with some additional calls to `geom_line`.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(pitching) +
  geom_point(aes(x = yearID, y = ERA), size = 0.3) +
  ylim(0, 10) + 
  geom_line(data = pitching_summary, 
            aes(x = yearID, y = mean), col = 'red')
```

You'll notice that the last line of code is a bit different than anything we've seen before.
In particular, we are specifying both the data and mapping within the same ggplot2 function.
If all of the information we want to include in the plot is coming from the same data source, it's enough to just specify the `data` argument in the first line, like we do with `ggplot(data = pitching)` and not in every subsequent call to functions like `geom_point` or `geom_line`.
However, whenever we want to add layers to a plot using data from another source (in this case, using data from `pitching_summary` to plot the average ERAs), we need to tell R explicitly and specify the data argument in `geom_line`.
