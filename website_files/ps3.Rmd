## MLB Batting Statistics

In this problem set, you will practice using the pipe `%>%` and grouped calculations with batting statistics taken from the Lahman dataset.
We will compute the same statistics as we did in [Problem Set 3](ps3.html) and also standardize these statistics within year, year and league, and also historical era.

To load the batting data into R, we can do the following
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
batting <- as_tibble(Batting)
```


Unfortunately, some statistics like hit-by-pitch (HBP) were not recorded in the earlier decades of baseball. 
In the tbl, these missing values are designated `NA`.
To see some of these, we can run the following code:
```{r}
batting %>% 
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, AB, BB, HBP, SH, SF, IBB, GIDP)
```

A common convention for dealing with the missing values when computing $\text{PA}$ is to replace the `NA` with a `0`.
To do this, we can use the function `replace_na()` within a pipe as follows. 
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
batting <- 
  batting %>% 
  replace_na(list(IBB = 0, HBP = 0, SH = 0, SF = 0, GIDP = 0))
batting %>% select(playerID, yearID, teamID, AB, BB, HBP, SH, SF, IBB)

```
The syntax for `replace_na()` is a bit involved but the basic idea is you have to specify the value you want to replace each `NA`.
When using `replace_na()` it is very important to remember to include the `list(...)` bit. 

1. Load the Lahman data and run the above code to create the tbl `Batting`, which has replaced all of the `NA`' in the columns `IBB, HBP, SH, SF` and GIDP`. 

2. Using the pipe `%>%`, `mutate()`, `filter()`, and `select()`, create a tbl `batting` by:

- Adding columns (with `mutate()`) for plate appearances (PA), unintentional walks (uBB), singles (X1B), batting average (BA), on-base percentage (OBP), on-base plus slugging (OPS), and weighted On-Base Average (wOBA). Note that the formula for plate appearances is $\text{PA} = \text{AB} + \text{BB} + \text{HBP} + \text{SH} + \text{SF}.$ Formulae for the remaining statistics are given in [Problem Set 3](ps3.html).
- Pulling out only those rows of players with at least 502 plate appearances **and** who played in either the AL or NL with `filter()`
- Select the following columns: playerID, yearID, lgID, teamID, PA, BA, OBP, OPS, wOBA. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
batting <-
  batting %>%
  replace_na(list(HBP = 0, SH = 0, SF = 0, IBB = 0)) %>%
  mutate(PA = AB + BB + HBP + SH + SF,
         X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR,
         uBB = BB - IBB,
         BA = H/AB,
         OBP = (H + BB + HBP)/(AB + BB + HBP + SF),
         SLG = (X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB,
         OPS = OBP + SLG,
         wOBA = (0.687 * uBB + 0.718 * HBP + 0.81 * X1B + 1.256 * X2B + 1.594 * X3B+ 2.065 * HR)/(AB + uBB + SF + HBP)
         ) %>%
  filter(lgID %in% c('AL', 'NL') & PA >= 502.2) %>% 
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, lgID, PA,BA, OBP, OPS, wOBA)
```

3. Standardize each of BA, OBP, OPS, and wOBA using data from all of the years. Who were the best and worst batters according to these four metrics? Name the columns containing these new standardizedvalues `zBA_all`, `zOPB_all`, etc. *Remember, you must re-define the `standardize()` function we wrote in [Module 4](module4.html)*

```{r batting-standardize}
standardize <- function(x){ (x - mean(x))/sd(x)}
batting <-
  batting %>%
  mutate(zBA_all = standardize(BA),
         zOBP_all = standardize(OBP),
         zOPS_all = standardize(OPS),
         zwOBA_all = standardize(wOBA))
```

4. Group `batting` by year and compute the standardized BA, OBP, OPS, and wOBA within each year. Now who are the best and worst batters according to the four measures? Name the columns containing these new standardized values `zBA_year`, `zOBP_year`, etc. 

```{r batting-standardized-year}
batting <- 
  batting %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  mutate(zBA_year = standardize(BA),
         zOBP_year = standardize(OBP),
         zOPS_year = standardize(OPS),
         zwOBA_year = standardize(wOBA))
```


5. Remove the grouping by year and instead group by year and league. Once again, standardize OBP, OPS, and wOBA within each league-year combination. Are the best and worst batters still the same? Name the columns containing these new standardized valuse `zBA_year_lg`, `zOBP_year_lg`, etc. 

```{r year-lg}
batting <- 
  batting %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  mutate(zBA_year_lg = standardize(BA),
         zOBP_year_lg = standardize(OBP),
         zOPS_year_lg = standardize(OPS),
         zwOBA_year_lg = standardize(wOBA))
```

6. Remove the grouping you created in Problem 4. Bill James [divided baseball history into several eras](https://www.billjamesonline.com/dividing_baseball_history_into_eras/) as follows:

* Pioneer Era: 1871 -- 1892
* Spitball Era: 1893 -- 1919
* Landis Era: 1920 -- 1946
* Baby Boomer Era: 1947 -- 1968
* Artifical Turf Era: 1969 -- 1992
* Camden Yards Era: 1993 -- present

```{r hist-era}
batting <-
  batting %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(HIST_ERA = case_when(
    1871 <= yearID & yearID <= 1892 ~ "Pioneer",
    1893 <= yearID & yearID <= 1919 ~ "Spitball",
    1920 <= yearID & yearID <= 1946 ~ "Landis",
    1947 <= yearID & yearID <= 1968 ~ "Baby Boomer",
    1969 <= yearID & yearID <= 1992 ~ "Artifical Turf",
    1993 <= yearID ~ "Camden Yards")) %>%
  group_by(HIST_ERA) %>%
  mutate(zBA_hist = standardize(BA),
         zOBP_hist = standardize(OBP),
         zOPS_hist = standardize(OPS),
         zwOBA_hist = standardize(wOBA))
```


Use `mutate()` and `case_when()` (just like we did in [Module 3](module3.html)) to add a column called Hist_era to `batting` that records the historical era.

7. Group `batting` by Hist_era and standardize BA, OBP, OPS, and wOBA within historical era. Who are the best and worst batters now? Name the columns containing these new stanardized values `zBA_hist`, `zOBP_hist`, etc.

8. Remove the grouping you added in Problem 6.


## MLB Payroll and Winnings

<!--In lecture, Professory Wyner discussed the relationship between a team's payroll and its winning percentage.
In particular, for each season, he computed the "relative payroll" of each team by taking its payroll and dividing it by the median of payrolls of all teams in that seaosn.
We will replicate his analysis in the following problems.
-->
Recall from [Problem Set 2](ps2.html), we plotted the relative payroll of MLB teams against their winning percentage. 
In that problem set, we read in a file that had included the relative payroll for each team as a separate column.
To get some additional practice with dplyr, we will read in a different dataset and re-compute these relative payrolls.

1. Remember the function we wrote in [Module 4](module4.html) to standardize various statistics?
It is reproduced below
```{r}
standardize <- function(x){
  mu <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  sigma <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return( (x - mu)/sigma)
}
```
We need to write another function in order to compute "relative payroll".
This function will take in a vector `x`, compute its median, and then divides every element of `x` by the median.
```{r}
relative <- function(x){
  med <- median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return( x/med )  
}
```

2. Read in the [MLB Payroll Data](data/mlb_payrolls.csv) and load it into a tibble called `mlb_payrolls`.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mlb_payrolls <- read_csv(file = "data/mlb_payrolls.csv")
```


3. Using the pipe `%>%`, `group_by()`, and `mutate()`, add a column to `mlb_payrolls` that contains the relative payroll for each team.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mlb_payrolls <- 
  mlb_payrolls %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  mutate(Relative_Payroll = relative(Team_Payroll))
```

4. Make a scatterplot of winning percentage against relative payrolls. Comment on the relationship. Your scatterplot should be identical to one you made in [Problem Set 2](ps2.html).
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mlb_payrolls) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Relative_Payroll, y = Winning_Percentage))
```

5. Using the `summarize()` function, compute the average team payroll and relative payroll for each year. Save these results in a new tbl called `payroll_avg`. 

6. Make a scatterplot that shows how team payrolls have evolved over the year. Similar to what we did in [Module 4](module4.html), add a line to this scatterplot that shows the average team payroll. Do the same thing for relative payroll. What do you notice about the average team payroll and relative payroll? 

7. As you will see in coming lectures, correlation is a measure of the strength of the *linear* relationship between two variables. The closer to +1 or -1 the correlation between two variables is, the more predictable they are of each other. We can compute it using the `cor()` function. Using `summary()` and `cor()`, compute the correlation between relative payroll and winning percentage within each year. What do you notice about how the relationship between winning percentage and relative payroll changes year to year? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mlb_payrolls %>%
  summarize(cor = cor(Winning_Percentage, Relative_Payroll))
```

## A Challenge Question

Without running the code, work with your teammates to see if you can figure out what the code below is doing.

```{r ps3-challenge, tidy = FALSE}
batting_2014_2015 <-
  batting %>%
  filter(yearID %in% c(2014, 2015)) %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  filter(n() == 2) %>% 
  select(playerID, yearID, BA) %>%
  arrange(playerID)
```

2. Run the code above and save the tbl `batting_2014_2015.RData` to the file "data/batting_2014_2015.RData". We will return to this dataset in [Lecture 4](lecture4.html).
<!-- We probably need to melt data here -->
