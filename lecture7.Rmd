In [Lecture 4](lecture4.html) and [Lecture 6](lecture6.html), we started building a model for predicting a baseball player's 2015 batting average using his 2014 batting average. We found that some models, even though they fit the data quite well, appeared to *overfit* and may not predict future observations well. Overfitting happens when the model is too complex; the model is improperly describing the random error rather than properly describing the relationship between variables. We will switch gears a little bit and discuss how to diagnose overfit issues using data on field goals in the NFL.


## Training and Testing Paradigm

Suppose we have fit multiple models to a given dataset. How should we choose which model is the best?  

One strategy might be to see how well the models predict the data we used to fit them. While this seems intuitive, it is possible to "over-learn" the patterns in this training data. Over-learning leads models to apply only the sample with which it was built, 
not the overall population or future data instances

A common alternative is to split our original dataset into two parts: a *training* set and a *testing* set. We fit all of our models on the training set and then see how well they predict the values in the testing set. Think of the training set as a sample and the testing set as a population.


## Field Goal Success in the NFL

The file [nfl_fg_train.csv](data/nfl_fg_train.csv) contains a large dataset about field goals attempted in the NFL between 2005 and 2015. First, we will train several models of field goal success with this data. Then, we will evaluate their predictive performance using the data contained in [nfl_fg_test.csv](data/nfl_fg_test.csv). Download both of these files and move them to your "data" folder. 

```{r load fg_train}
fg_train <- read_csv("data/nfl_fg_train.csv")
```

The simplest forecast for field goal success probability is the overall average success rate. This forecast does not differentiate between players or attempt to adjust for distance or other game contexts. To compute this forecast, we need to find the average of the data in the column "Success." The code below adds a column to the tbl called "phat_all".

```{r phat_all}
fg_train <- 
  fg_train %>%
  mutate(phat_all = mean(Success))
```

It turns out that kickers make just over 83% of their attempts. However, we know that there are some truly elite kickers (e.g. Justin Tucker) who make well over 83% of their attempts, and other kickers (e.g. Billy Cundiff) who make less than 83% of their attempts. Instead of forecasting field goal success probabilities with the overall average, we could compute each individual kicker's conversion rate. This can be done using `group_by()` and `mutate()`. In the code below, we add a column to `fg_train` called "phat_kicker", which contains each kicker's individual field goal conversion rate. Notice that because we adding a grouping to carry out this computation, we need to remove the grouping using `ungroup()` when we're done.

```{r phat_kicker}
fg_train <- 
  fg_train %>% 
  group_by(Kicker) %>%
  mutate(phat_kicker = mean(Success)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Intuitively, distance is one of the main factors of whether a kicker makes a field goal. We will use the `cut()` function to bin the data according to distance. Then, we will compute the conversion rate (averaged over all kickers) within each bin. To do this properly, we must have used the `ungroup()` function at the end of our last line of code.

In our dataset, the shortest field goal attempt was 18 yards and the longest was 76. We will begin by binning our data into 10 yard increments, 10 -- 20, 20 -- 30, ..., 70 -- 80. We then save the bin label in a column called "Dist_10" and the predictions in a column called "phat_dist_10".

```{r phat_dist_10}
fg_train <-
  fg_train %>%
  mutate(Dist_10 = cut(Distance, breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 80, by = 10))) %>%
  group_by(Dist_10) %>%
  mutate(phat_dist_10 = mean(Success)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

We can now look at a scatter plot of distance and our forecasts "phat_dist_10". Since there are many attempts from certain yardages, we'll use alpha-blending (see [Lecture 2](lecture2.html) for a refresher on this!) to change change the transparency of the points according to their frequency. Essentially, darker dots have higher n values than lighter dots.

It certainly looks like our predictions make some intuitive sense: the estimated probability of making a field goal decreases as the distance increases. 

```{r plot phat_dist_10}
fg_plot <- ggplot(fg_train) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Distance, y = phat_dist_10), alpha = 0.2)
fg_plot
```

We also could have binned field goal Distance 5- or 2-yard increments, saving bin labels into columns called "Dist_5" or "Dist_2". And similar to the 10-yard bins, we could add columns to `fg_train` that computes the overall conversion rate within each of these 5-yard or 2-yard bins.

```{r dist_5 dist_2}
fg_train <- fg_train %>%
  mutate(Dist_5 = cut(Distance, breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 80, by = 5))) %>%
  group_by(Dist_5) %>%
  mutate(phat_dist_5 = mean(Success)) %>%
  ungroup()
fg_train <- fg_train %>%
  mutate(Dist_2 = cut(Distance, breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 80, by = 2))) %>%
  group_by(Dist_2) %>%
  mutate(phat_dist_2 = mean(Success)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Now we plot our predictions based on three different binning methods.

```{r plot 3 bins}
fg_plot  <- 
  ggplot(fg_train) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Distance, y = phat_dist_10), alpha = 0.1, col = 'black') +
  geom_point(aes(x = Distance, y = phat_dist_5), alpha = 0.1, col = 'blue') + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Distance, y = phat_dist_2), alpha = 0.1, col = 'red')
fg_plot
```

Now when we binned our data into 2-yard increments, we find that our forecasts are no longer monotonic decreasing. Probability of making a field decreases overall; but in our 2-yard bins, the probability increases from 44 to 46 and 52 to 54 years. Remember, monotonic means only decreasing or only increasing for all values. In [Lecture 8](lecture8.html), we'll address this with a more formal regression method. 


## Assessing Predictions

We now have several predictive models of field goal success: phat_all, phat_kicker, phat_dist_10, phat_dist_5, and phat_dist_2. Recall from [Lecture 4](lecture4.html) that to assess how well we are predicting a continuous outcome, we could use the RMSE. When predicting a binary outcome, we have a few more options. To set the stage, let $y_{i}$ be the outcome of the $i^{\text{th}}$ observation and let $\hat{p}_{i}$ be the forecasted probability that $y_{i} = 1.$ (i.e. of making the FG)

The [Brier Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) is defined as
$$
BS = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(y_{i} - \hat{p}_{i})^{2}}
$$
Looking at the formula, we see that the Brier score is just the mean square error of our forecasts. Using code that is very nearly identical to that used to compute RSME in [Lecture 4](lecture4.html), we can compute the Brier score of each of our prediction models.

```{r fg_train Brier}
summarize(fg_train,
          phat_all = mean( (Success - phat_all)^2),
          phat_kicker = mean( (Success - phat_kicker)^2),
          phat_dist_10 = mean( (Success - phat_dist_10)^2),
          phat_dist_5 = mean( (Success - phat_dist_5)^2),
          phat_dist_2 = mean( (Success - phat_dist_2)^2))
```

Which model has the lowest Brier score? Do you think this model over-fits the data? 

Before assessing how well our models predict *out-of-sample*, it will be useful to create tibbles that summarize each model's forecasts. For instance, when we grouped the data by kickers, we don't need multiple rows recording the same prediction for each kicker. Instead, we can create a tbl called `phat_kicker` which has one row per kicker and two columns, one identifying kicker and one for the associated forecast:

```{r group_by kicker}
phat_kicker <- 
  fg_train %>%
  group_by(Kicker) %>%
  summarize(phat_kicker = mean(Success))
```

Create similar tibbles for phat_dist_10, phat_dist_5, and phat_dist_2.

```{r group_by dists}
phat_dist_10 <- 
  fg_train %>%
  group_by(Dist_10) %>%
  summarize(phat_dist_10 = mean(Success))
phat_dist_5 <- 
  fg_train %>%
  group_by(Dist_5) %>%
  summarize(phat_dist_5 = mean(Success))
phat_dist_2 <- 
  fg_train %>%
  group_by(Dist_2) %>%
  summarize(phat_dist_2 = mean(Success))
```

The file "nfl_fg_test.csv" contains additional data on more field goals kicked between 2005 and 2015. Since we have not used the data in this file to train our models, we can get a sense of the *out-of-sample* predictive performance of our models by looking at how well they predict these field goals. We first load the data into a tbl called `fg_test`.

```{r load fg_test}
fg_test <- read_csv("data/nfl_fg_test.csv")
```

Using `mutate()` and `cut()`, add columns "Dist_10", "Dist_5", and "Dist_2" to `fg_test` that bin the data into 10-yard, 5-yard, and 2-yard increments. 

```{r fg_test add bins}
fg_test <-
  fg_test %>%
  mutate(Dist_10 = cut(Distance, breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 80, by = 10)),
         Dist_5 = cut(Distance, breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 80, by = 5)),
         Dist_2 = cut(Distance, breaks = seq(from = 10, to = 80, by = 2)))
```

We are now ready to apply our `fg_train` model's forecasts to `fg_test`. For instance, we can add the forecast from "phat_all", which is just the overall conversion rate averaged over all kickers. Notice that instead of computing the mean of the column "Success" from `fg_test`, we are computing the mean from `fg_train`. 

```{r fg_test phat_all}
fg_test <-
  fg_test %>%
  mutate(phat_all = mean(fg_train$Success))
```

Joining is a powerful technique to combine data from two different tables based on a *key*.  The key is what enables us to match rows between the tables. For instance, to add the forecasts from the tbl `phat_kicker` to the tbl `fg_test` join works row-by-row. First, for each field goal in `fg_test`, the function identifies the kicker who attempted the field goal. Then it matches that kicker with corresponding kicker row from the tbl `phat_kicker`. The join function then appends that kicker's forecast from `phat_kicker` to the row in `fg_test.` What we have just described is what is known as an "inner join". In this situation, the key was the Kicker. The code to carry out these operations is given below.

```{r fg_test join}
fg_test <-
  fg_test %>%
  inner_join(phat_kicker, by = "Kicker")
```

To verify that we have successfully performed this join, we can print out a few rows of `fg_test`:

```{r verify join}
select(fg_test, Kicker, Success, phat_all, phat_kicker)
```

Let's unpack the inner join code line-by-line:  in the first two lines, we are telling R that we want to over-write `fg_test`. Next, we pipe `fg_test` to the function `inner_join`, which takes two more arguments.  The first argument `phat_kicker` tells the function where the additional data corresponding to each key value is. The last argument `by = "Kicker"` tells the function that the key we want to use is the kicker.

Mimic the code above, we can add columns for `fg_test` for the remaining three predictive models: `phat_dist_10`, `phat_dist_5`, and `phat_dist_2`.

```{r fg_test add phat_dist}
fg_test <- 
  fg_test %>%
  inner_join(phat_dist_10, by = "Dist_10") %>%
  inner_join(phat_dist_5, by = "Dist_5") %>%
  inner_join(phat_dist_2, by = "Dist_2")
```

Now, we can compute the out-of-sample Brier scores for each of our models. Which has the best out-of-sample performance?

```{r fg_test Brier, echo = FALSE}
summarise(fg_test,
          phat_all = mean( (Success - phat_all)^2),
          phat_kicker = mean( (Success - phat_kicker)^2),
          phat_dist_10 = mean( (Success - phat_dist_10)^2),
          phat_dist_5 = mean( (Success - phat_dist_5)^2),
          phat_dist_2 = mean( (Success - phat_dist_2)^2))
```


## Looking ahead to tomorrow

Tomorrow, we are going to use *logistic regression* to take the "binning-and-averaging" approach we used above to its logical extreme (i.e. what would happen if we made our bins infinitesimally small).
In order to do that, we will want to save our tbls `fg_train` and `fg_test`:

```{r save train test}
save(fg_train, fg_test, file = "data/nfl_fg.RData")
```
