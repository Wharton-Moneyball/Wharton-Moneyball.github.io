## Tidy Data

Before we jump into any analysis, we wanted to start by discussing the notion of "tidy data" because not all datasets you find will be organized in a form that's easy to analyze. Thus, you'll often find yourself in a situation where you'll need to manipulate the data into a better form.  The entire `tidyverse` ecosystem of packages and functions is based on analyzing datasets that are in a "tidy" format. This format, at its simplest, must adhere to the following three rules:

1. Each **variable** must have its own **column**.
2. Each **observation** must have its own **row**.
3. Each **value** must have its own **cell**.

To make the above discussion much more concrete, let's go back to the dataset we created in the challenge question at the end of [Problem Set 3](ps3.html). If you haven't yet completed that, you can download the final [batting_2014_2015 dataset here](data/batting_2014_2015.RData) (then save it to your "data" folder). Printing out the tbl, we see that there is a separate row for each "player-season".

```{r load batting_2014_2015}
library(tidyverse)
load("data/batting_2014_2015.RData")
batting_2014_2015
```

Let's say we want to study the relationship between a player's 2014 batting average and his 2015 batting average. In this case, each observation is a player, and that player has two associated variables; batting average in 2014, and batting average in 2015. We can do this with the `pivot_wider` function. The `names_from` argument indicates the new column(s) in the table - in this case `yearID`. The `values_from` then indicates what values go in our new columns - in this case `BA`. We can use the `names_prefix` argument to easily rename the columns with `BA_` so that our columns don't start with numbers.

```{r pivot_wider batting_2014_2015}
batting_2014_2015 <- batting_2014_2015 %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = yearID,
    values_from = BA,
    names_prefix = "BA_"
  )
head(batting_2014_2015)
```

When we print out `batting_2014_2015`, we notice that it is easier to read in this proper "tidy" format. Moreover, many of the `tidyverse` functions that we've covered and will continue to learn are much simpler to implement when used on data of this form. We'll continue to see examples of how to "tidy" up our data as we go through the lectures and problem sets.

It can also be helpful to work with the original, "long" format of the data when making visualizations. We can easily revert back to this form with pivot longer, which will take the compact version and unpack it back into one row per year. `cols` represents the column titles that are instead being converted into a new column - in this case `BA_2014` and `BA_2015`. The `names_to` argument indicates the name of the new column that will contain these values, and the `values_to` argument indicates the name of the new column that will contain the values themselves. We can then mutate to remove the `BA_` prefix and then see that our table looks like our original data. 
```{r pivot_longer batting_2014_2015}
batting_2014_2015_long <- batting_2014_2015 %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("BA_"),
    names_to = "yearID",
    values_to = "BA"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(yearID = sub("BA_", "", yearID))

head(batting_2014_2015_long)
```

We can use this `batting_2014_2015_long` tbl to make a bar plot with `geom_col` which shows the batting averages of each player in 2014 and 2015.
```{r}
batting_2014_2015_slice <- batting_2014_2015_long %>%
  slice_head(n=20) #take the first 10 players alphabetically 

ggplot(batting_2014_2015_slice, aes(x = playerID, y = BA, fill = yearID)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
These visualizations can be helpful to compare player statistics. We can now move back to using our cleaned, tidy data for predictions. 

## Predicting Batting Averages

Imagine there's one more player who played in both 2014 and 2015 but who is not in our dataset. Without knowing anything else about the player, how could we predict their 2015 batting average using the data that we have? The simplest thing (and as it turns out the best thing) to do in this case is to use the overall mean of the 2015 batting averages in our dataset to predict the batting average of this extra player. 

Now what if we also told you this extra player's 2014 batting average? Can we improve on this simple prediction? In this section, we will propose several different ways of predicting 2015 batting average using 2014 batting average. In order to pick the best one, we can assess how well each method predicts the actual 2015 batting averages in our tbl.  We will add columns to our tbl containing these predictions. To get things started, let's add a column containing the overall mean of the 2015 batting averages. It turns out that this mean is 0.273, whereas the mean 2014 batting average is 0.272.

```{r batting yhat_0}
batting_2014_2015 <-
  batting_2014_2015 %>% 
  mutate(yhat_0 = mean(BA_2015))
batting_2014_2015
```

If the 2014 batting average had no predictive power at all, then this overall mean will be the best prediction model possible, given what data we have. Plotting the 2015 batting averages against the 2014 batting averages allows us to assess visually whether there is any relationship between the two variables.We have added dashed red horizontal and vertical lines at the overall means of the 2014 and 2015 data, respectively.

```{r plot batting yhat_0}
ggplot(batting_2014_2015) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = BA_2015), col = 'black', shape = 16, size = 0.9) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.273, col = 'red', lty = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.272, col = 'red', lty = 2)
```

It certainly looks like there is a relationship! So it's at least plausible that if we use the 2014 batting averages to make predictions for 2015, we can do better than relying on just the average of the 2015 averages.

Looking carefully at the plot, we see that most players with below average batting averages in 2014 tended to also have below average batting averages in 2015. Similarly, most players with above average batting averages in 2014 tended to have above average batting averages in 2015. 

One way to improve on the simple prediction above would be as follows:

1. Divide the players into two groups, one for those with above average BA in 2014 and one for those with below average BA in 2014.
2. Average the 2015 BA within each of these groups and use these averages as the prediction for each member of the group.

In order to do this, we will need to mutate our tbl `batting_2014_2015` with a column indicating to which group each player belongs. Then we can pass this column to `group_by()` and compute the average BA_2015 within each group. To create the column indicating group membership, we will use the powerful `cut()` function, which divides the range of a numerical vector into intervals and recodes the numerical values according to which interval they fall.

The following code chunk does precisely that with two more steps: once we have made our predictions, we ungroup the tbl and we can drop the column indicating the interval in which our observation falls.

```{r batting yhat_1}
batting_2014_2015 <- 
  batting_2014_2015 %>%
  mutate(bins = cut(BA_2014, breaks = c(0.15, 0.272, 0.40))) %>%
  group_by(bins) %>%
  mutate(yhat_1 = mean(BA_2015)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-bins)
batting_2014_2015
```

When we run this code and print out our tbl, we see that there is a new column called "yhat_1" that contains our new predictions. Before proceeding, we should talk a bit about the syntax use in `cut()`. The first argument is the variable we want to discretize. The next argument, `breaks = ` is a vector that tells R where the endpoints of these intervals are. These are often called "cut points" In this particular case, we wanted to divide the players into those with below average batting averages in 2014 and above average batting averages in 2015. The first element of the cut point vector, 0.15 is much less than the smallest BA_2014 value, whereas the second elements, 0.272, is the overall mean of the BA_2014 values. The last element, 0.40 is much greater than the largest BA_2014 value.

Now that we have two different ways of predicting 2015 batting averages, let us see how they compare, visually.

```{r plot batting yhat_1}
ggplot(batting_2014_2015) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = BA_2015), col = 'black', shape = 16, size = 0.9) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_0), col = 'red', shape = 3, size = 0.75) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_1), col = 'green', shape = 15, size = 0.75)
```

Visually it appears that the green squares (corresponding to yhat_1) are a bit closer to the actual values than the red crosses (corresponding to yhat_0).  This would suggest that dividing the players into the two bins according to their 2014 batting average and using the average BA_2015 value within each bin as our forecast was better than using the overall average BA_2015 value for all players.

Of course, we can continue with this line of reasoning and divide the players into even more bins. When we do that, instead of hand-coding the vector of cut points, we can use the function `seq()` which generates a vector of equally spaced numbers. To demonstrate, suppose we wanted to divide the interval [0,1] into 10 equally sized intervals: (0,0.1], (0.1, 0.2], ..., (0.9, 1].  To get the vector of cutpoints, we need to tell `seq()` either how many points we wanted or the spacing between the points:

```{r seq fn}
seq(from = 0, to = 1, length = 11)
seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)
```

So let's say we wanted to divide the 2014 batting averages into intervals of length 0.05 and predict 2015 batting averages using the average BA_2015 values within the resulting bins. We could run the following:

```{r batting yhat_2}
batting_2014_2015 <- 
  batting_2014_2015 %>%
  mutate(bins = cut(BA_2014, breaks = seq(from = 0.15, to = 0.4, by = 0.05))) %>%
  group_by(bins) %>%
  mutate(yhat_2 = mean(BA_2015)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-bins)
batting_2014_2015
```

We can also visualize our new predictions, this time with blue triangles.

```{r plot batting yhat_2}
ggplot(batting_2014_2015) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = BA_2015), shape = 16, size = 0.9) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_0), col = 'red', shape = 3, size = 0.75) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_1), col = 'green', shape = 15, size = 0.75) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_2), col = 'blue', shape = 17, size = 0.75)
```

It appears that we are able to perfectly predict the 2015 batting average of the player with the lowest batting average in 2014. Why do you think this was the case?

Let's add two more predictions in which we divide the 2014 batting averages into bins of length 0.005 and 0.001. The code below generates these predictions, saves them to columns called "yhat_3" and "yhat_4" in our tbl, and then adds the predictions to the plot in purple and orange.

```{r batting yhat_3 yhat_4 plot}
batting_2014_2015 <- 
  batting_2014_2015 %>%
  mutate(bins = cut(BA_2014, breaks = seq(from = 0.15, to = 0.4, by = 0.005))) %>%
  group_by(bins) %>%
  mutate(yhat_3 = mean(BA_2015)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-bins)

batting_2014_2015 <- 
  batting_2014_2015 %>%
  mutate(bins = cut(BA_2014, breaks = seq(from = 0.15, to = 0.4, by = 0.001))) %>%
  group_by(bins) %>%
  mutate(yhat_4 = mean(BA_2015)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-bins)

ggplot(batting_2014_2015) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = BA_2015), shape = 16, size = 0.9) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_0), col = 'red', shape = 3, size = 0.75) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_1), col = 'green', shape = 15, size = 0.75) +
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_2), col = 'blue', shape = 17, size = 0.75) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_3), col = 'purple', shape = 8, size = 0.75) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = BA_2014, y = yhat_4), col = 'orange', shape = 10, size = 0.75)
```


## Assessing Predictive Performance

We now have a couple of different ways of predicting BA_2015. Qualitatively, the predictions in purple (formed by binning BA_2014 into very small intervals) appear to fit the observed data better than the blue, green, and red predictions. To assess the predictions quantitatively, we often rely on the root mean square error or RMSE. This is the square root of the mean square error (MSE), which is computed by averaging the squared difference between the actual values and the predicted values.

```{r summarize rmse}
reframe(batting_2014_2015, 
          rmse_0 = sqrt(mean((BA_2015 - yhat_0)^2)),
          rmse_1 = sqrt(mean((BA_2015 - yhat_1)^2)),
          rmse_2 = sqrt(mean((BA_2015 - yhat_2)^2)),
          rmse_3 = sqrt(mean((BA_2015 - yhat_3)^2)),
          rmse_4 = sqrt(mean((BA_2015 - yhat_4)^2)))
```
 
We see that the the orange predictions have the lowest RMSE, followed by the purple, blue, green, and red predictions. This tells us that the predictions formed by binning into smaller intervals fit the data better than the predictions formed by binning into larger intervals, confirming what we could see visually. 

Now, what if we continued this process, and formed bins that are infinitesimally small? Should we expect our predictions to be even better? However, think about the potential issues of doing so: most of the bins (an infinite number of them, in fact) would contain no data points. How could we remedy this issue? Perhaps, we could impose a constraint that our predictions must lie along a straight line, thus allowing the bins with data to help make predictions for the bins without data. You'll have some time to think about this concept, and then in [Lecture 6](lecture6.html) we will introduce linear regression which addresses this exact issue.
