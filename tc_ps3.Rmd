## Review Lecture 3 Notes

Please spend a few minutes reading through the notes from [Lecture 3](tc_lecture3.html). 
Like before, you should go through each code block with someone in your group and see if you can both explain to each other what all of the code does.

## NBA Three-Point Efficiency

In [Lecture 3](tc_lecture3.html) we saw that three-point shot rates have been increasing
over time by creating visualizations of the distributions for each season. 

Now, create the same visuals but use TPP as the continous variable of interest. As players
are attempting more three-pointers than ever before, are they also making them more?

Discuss with other students in your group the meaning of these plots.
