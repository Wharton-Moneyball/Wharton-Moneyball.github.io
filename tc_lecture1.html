<div id="setting-our-working-directory" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting our working directory</h2>
<p>The <em>working directory</em> is a really powerful concept in R – it
is where R saves any output files you create during an analysis and it
is the place where R looks for any data you want to read in. When you
installed R &amp; <code>RStudio</code> in <a
href="lecture0.html">Lecture 0</a>, we asked you to create a folder on
your Desktop called Moneyball. This will be your working directory for
the duration of the course.</p>
<p>Everytime you open RStudio, it automatically sets the working
directory to some default folder on your computer. To see what that is,
we’ll open RStudio and look at the console pane.
<!-- show console pane --></p>
<p>Once we open RStudio, before we do anything, we need to tell R to
change the working directory to our Moneyball folder. We can do this in
several ways. <!-- show the different ways to do this --></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the top toolbar, Session/Set Working Directory/Choose Working
Directory allows us to select and set our working directory from our
files.<br />
</li>
<li>The code <code>setwd("~/Desktop/Moneyball")</code> sets our working
directory to the Moneyball folder, and can be edited for any file
location.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important: for this week, everytime you open up RStudio, the
first thing you should do is set your working directory to the Moneyball
folder.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="the-tidyverse" class="section level2">
<h2>The tidyverse</h2>
<p>So far we have seen only the most basic of R’s functionality.
Arguably, one of the things that makes R so powerful is the ease with
which users are able to define their own functions and release them to
the public. As <a href="http://hadley.nz">Hadley Wickham</a> defines
them, “[R] packages are fundamental units of reproducible code. They
include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to
use them, and sample data.” As of July 8, 2018, there are 12,725
packages available from the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org">Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)</a>. The scope of these packages is vast: there are some designed
for scraping data from the web, pre-processing data to get it into an
analyzable format, performing standard and specialized statistical
analyses, and to publish your results. People have also released
packages tailored to very specific applications like analyzing baseball
data. There are also some more whimsical packages, like one that allow
you to display your favorite <a href="https://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> comic
strip!</p>
<p>For the rest of the course, we will be working within the <a
href="https://www.tidyverse.org/"><code>tidyverse</code></a>, which
consists of several R packages for data manipulation, exploration, and
visualization. They are all based on a common design philosophy, mostly
developed by Hadley Wickham (whose name you will encounter a lot as you
gain more experience with R). To access all of these packages, you first
need to install them (if you have not already) with the following
code:</p>
<p>The <code>install.packages()</code> function is one way of installing
packages in R. You can also click on the Packages tab in your RStudio
view and then click on Install to type in the package you want to
install.</p>
<p>Now with the <code>tidyverse</code> suite of packages installed, we
can load them with the following code:</p>
<p>When you do that, you’ll see a lot of output to the console, most of
which you can safely ignore for now.</p>
</div>
<div id="reading-in-tabular-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading in tabular data</h2>
<p>Almost all of the data we will encounter in this course (and in the
real world) will be <strong>tabular</strong>. Each row will represent a
separate <strong>observation</strong> and each column will record a
particular <strong>variable</strong>/measurement. For instance, the
table below lists different statistics for several basketball players
from the 2015-16 NBA regular season. The statistics are: * field goals
made (FGM) * field goal attempts (FGA) * three pointers made (TPM) *
three point attempts (TPA) * free throws made (FTM) * free throw
attempts (FTA)</p>
<center>
</center>
<p>Within the tidyverse, the standard way to store and manipulate
tabular data like this is to use what is known as a <code>tbl</code>
(pronounced <em>tibble</em>), synonymous with a spreadsheet or
<code>data.frame</code>. At a high-level, a <code>tbl</code> is a
two-dimensional array whose columns can be of different data types. That
is, the first column might be characters (e.g. the names of athletes)
and the second column can be numeric (e.g. the number of points
scored).</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you will be downloading all datasets we will
analyze to your “data” folder within your working directory (the
“Moneyball” folder). All of these datasets are in the form of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">comma-separated</a>
files, which have extension ‘.csv’.</p>
<p>Within the tidyverse, we can use the function <code>read_csv()</code>
to read in a csv file that is stored on your computer and create a
tibble containing all of the data. The dataset showed above is stored in
a csv file named “nba_shooting_small.csv” in the “data” folder of our
working directory. We will read it into R with the
<code>read_csv()</code> function like so:</p>
<p>Before proceeding, let us parse the syntax
<code>nba_shooting_small &lt;- read_csv(...)</code> The first thing to
notice is that we’re using the assignment operator that we saw in <a
href="ps0.html">Problem Set 0</a>. This tells R that we want it to
evalaute whatever is on the right-hand side (in this case
<code>read_csv(file = "data/nba_shooting_small.csv")</code>) and assign
the resulting evaluation to a new object called
<code>nba_shooting_small</code> (which R will create). We called the
function <code>read_csv()</code> with one argument <code>file</code>.
This argument is the <em>relative path</em> of the CSV file that we want
to read into R. Basically, R starts in the working directory and first
looks for a folder called “data.” If it finds such a folder, it looks
inside it for a file called “nba_shooting_small.csv.” If it finds the
file, it creates a <code>tbl</code> called
<code>nba_shooting_small</code> that contains all of the data.</p>
<p>When we type in the command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or
<kbd>Return</kbd>, we see some output printed to the console. This is
<code>read_csv</code> telling us that it (a) found the file, (b) read it
in successfully, and (c) identified the type of data stored in each
column. We see, for instance, that the column named “PLAYER” contains
<em>character strings</em>, and is parsed as
<code>col_character()</code>. Similarly, the number of field goals made
(“FGM”) is parsed as integer data.</p>
<p>When we print out our tbl, R outputs many things: the dimension (in
this case, <span class="math inline">\(10 \times 7\)</span>), the column
names, the <em>type</em> of data included in each column, and then the
actual data.</p>
</div>
<div id="wrangling-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrangling Data</h2>
<p>Now that we have read in our dataset, we’re ready to begin analyzing
it. Very often, our analysis will involve some type of manipulation or
<em>wrangling</em> of the data contained in the <code>tbl</code>. For
instance, we may want to compute some new summary statistic based on the
data in the table. In our NBA example, we could compute, say, each
player’s field goal percentage. Alternatively, we could subset our data
to find all players who took at least 100 three point shots and made at
least 80% of their free throws. One package within the
<code>tidyverse</code> is called <code>dplyr</code> and it contains five
main functions corresponding to the most common things that you’ll end
up doing to your data. Over the next two days, we will learn each of
these:</p>
<ul>
<li>reorder the rows with <code>arrange()</code>,</li>
<li>creating new variables that are functions of existing variables with
<code>mutate()</code>,</li>
<li>identify observations satisfying certain conditions with
<code>filter()</code>,</li>
<li>picking a subset of variables by names with
<code>select()</code>,</li>
<li>generating simple summaries of the data with
<code>summarize()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="arranging-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Arranging Data</h3>
<p>The <code>arrange()</code> function works by taking a tbl and a set
of column names and sorting the data according to the values in these
columns.</p>
<p>The code above takes our <code>tbl</code> and sorts the rows in
ascending order of FGA. We see that Marc Gasol took the fewest number of
field goals (707) while James Harden and Stephen Curry attempted more
than twice as many. We could also sort the players in descending order
using <code>desc()</code>:</p>
<p>In this small dataset, no two players attempted the same number of
field goals. In larger datasets (like the one you’ll see in <a
href="tc_ps1.html">Problem Set 1</a>), it can be the case that there are
multiple rows with the same value in a given column. When arranging the
rows of a <code>tbl</code>, to break ties, we can specify more than
column. For instance, the code below sorts the players first by the
number of field goal attempts and then by the number of three point
attempts.</p>
<p>Now consider the two lines of code:</p>
<p>In the first line, we’ve sorted the players in alphabet order of
their first name. But when we print out our <code>tbl</code>,
<code>nba_shooting_small</code>, we see that the players are no longer
sorted. This is because <code>dplyr</code> (and most other R) functions
<strong>never</strong> modify their input but work by creating a copy
and modifying that copy. If we wanted to preserve the new ordering, we
would have to <em>overwrite</em> <code>nba_shooting_small</code> using a
combination of the assignment operator and <code>arrange()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-new-variables-from-old" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating new variables from old</h3>
<p>While arranging our data is useful, it is not quite sufficient to
determine which player is the best shooter in our dataset. Perhaps the
simplest way to compare players’ shooting ability is with field goal
percentage (FGP). We can compute this percentage using the formula <span
class="math inline">\(\text{FGP} =
\frac{\text{FGM}}{\text{FGA}}.\)</span> We use the function
<code>mutate()</code> to add a column to our <code>tbl</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax for <code>mutate()</code> looks kind of similar to
<code>arrange()</code>: the first argument tells R what <code>tbl</code>
we want to manipulate and the second argument tells R how to compute
FGP. As expected, when we run this command, R returns a
`<code>tbl</code> with a new column containing the field goal percentage
for each of these 10 players. Just like with <code>arrange()</code>, if
we call <code>mutate()</code> by itself, R will not add the new column
to our existing data frame. In order to permanently add a column for
field goal percentages to <code>nba_shooting_small</code>, we’re going
to need to use the assignment operator.</p>
<p>It turns out that we can add <em>multiple</em> columns to a
<code>tbl</code> at once by passing more arguments to
<code>mutate()</code>, one for each column we wish to define.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a-quick-digression-r-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>A quick digression: R Scripts</h2>
<p>Up to this point, we have been working strictly within the R console,
proceeding line-by-line. In the previous code block, we tried to add
three columns to our <code>tbl</code> and the <code>mutate</code> call
got a little bit over-whelming. Imagine trying to add five or six more
columns simultaneously! As our commands become more and more complex,
you’ll find that using the console can get pretty cramped. And if you
make a mistake in entering your code, you’ll get an error and have to
start all over again. Plus, when we start a new session of RStudio, the
console is cleared. How can we save the commands we typed into R? We do
so using an <strong>R Script</strong>.</p>
<p>An R Script is a file type which R recognizes as storing R commands
and is saved as a .R file. R Scripts are useful as we can edit our code
before sending it to be run in the console.</p>
<p>We can start a new R Script by clicking on the top left symbol in
RStudio and selecting “R Script”.</p>
<p><img src="figures/lecture1_fig1.png" /></p>
<p>The untitled R Script will then appear in the top left hand box of
RStudio.</p>
<p><img src="figures/lecture1_fig2.png" /></p>
<p>In the R Script, type the following:</p>
<pre><code>2 * 3
x &lt;- 4
sqrt(x)</code></pre>
<p>Now our code is just sitting in the R Script. To run the code (that
is, evaluate it in the console) we click the “Run” button in the top
right of the script. This will run one line of code at a time -
whichever line the cursor is on. Place your cursor on the first line and
click “Run”. Observe how <code>2 * 3</code> now appears in the console,
as well as the output <code>6</code>.</p>
<p><img src="figures/lecture1_fig3.png" /></p>
<p>If we want to run multiple lines at once, we highlight them all and
click “Run”.</p>
<p><img src="figures/lecture1_fig4.png" /></p>
<p>Note in the above that we had to run <code>x &lt;- 4</code> before
<code>sqrt(x)</code>. We need to define our variables first and run this
code in the console before performing calculations with those variables.
The console can’t “see” the script unless you run the code in the
script.</p>
<p>One very nice thing about RStudio’s script editor is that it will
highlight syntax errors with a red squiggly line and a red cross in the
sidebar. If you move your mouse over the line, a pop-up will appear that
can help you diagnose the potential problem.</p>
<p>Another advantage of R scripts is that you can add comments to your
code, which are preceded by the pound sign / hash sign <code>#</code>.
Comments are useful because they allow you to explain what your code is
doing. <strong>Throughout the rest of this course, we will be working
almost exclusively with R scripts rather than directly entering commands
into the console.</strong> For the sake of organization, you should save
all of your scripts into the ‘scripts’ folder we created within the
‘Moneyball’ working directory.</p>

<p>One huge advantage with working with R script is the ability to
separate commands onto multiple lines. For instance, to add columns for
FGP, FTP, and TPP to our tbl, we can write the following in our script
window.</p>
<p>Notice how we have separated our command into multiple lines. This
makes our script much easier to read.</p>
<div id="chaining-commands-together-with-pipes" class="section level3">
<h3>Chaining commands together with pipes</h3>
<p>When dealing with data, we often want to <strong>chain</strong>
multiple commands together. People will often describe the entire
process of reading in data, wrangling it with commands like
<code>mutate</code> and <code>arrange</code>, then creating visuals and
models, as the data analysis <strong>pipeline</strong>. The <strong>pipe
operator</strong> <code>%&gt;%</code> is a convenient tool in the
<code>tidyverse</code> that allows us to create a sequence of code to
analyze data, such as the following code to arrange in descending order
the players based on the rate of field goal attempts that are three
point attempts:</p>
<p>Let’s break down what’s happening here. First, R “pipes” the
<code>tbl</code> <code>nba_shooting_small</code> into into
<code>mutate</code> to create a new variable
<code>three_point_fg_rate</code>. Then it pipes the result of this
<code>mutate</code> into <code>arrange</code> to sort the players based
on this newly created column. With this <strong>pipeline</strong> we
have created a new variable, and view the players in descending order
without having to specify the data <code>nba_shooting_small</code> more
than once! The sequence of analysis flow naturally top-to-bottom and
puts the emphasis on the <em>actions</em> being carried out by the
analyst (like the functions <code>mutate</code> and
<code>arrange</code>) and the final output rather than a bunch of
temporary <code>tbl</code>’s that may not be of much interest.</p>
<p>We will be using the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> operator for the
remainder of the week, and you will see how convenient it is to use in
the <a href="tc_lecture2.html">next lecture</a> when making
visualizations. Next, proceed to practice the basics of reading and
wrangling data in <a href="tc_ps1.html">Problem Set 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are several conventions for formatting
code when using the pipe. See <a
href="http://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html">here</a> and <a
href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html">here</a> for much more
information and for some advanced “special” pipes.</p>
