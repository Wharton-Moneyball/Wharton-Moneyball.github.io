## Setting our working directory

The *working directory* is a really powerful concept in R -- it is where R saves any output files you create during an analysis and it is the place where R looks for any data you want to read in.
When you installed R & RStudio in [Lecture 0](lecture0.html), we asked you to create a folder on your Desktop called Moneyball.
This will be your working directory for the duration of the course. 

Every time you open RStudio, it automatically sets the working directory to some default folder on your computer.
To see what that is, we'll open RStudio and look at the console pane
<!-- show console pane -->
We can also check our working directory with the code `getwd()`

Once we open RStudio, before we do anything, we need to tell R to change the working directory to our Moneyball folder.
We can do this in a couple of ways:
<!-- show the different ways to do this -->

1. In the top toolbar, Session/Set Working Directory/Choose Working Directory allows us to select and set our working directory from our files.  
2. The code `setwd("~/Desktop/Moneyball")` sets our working directory to the Moneyball folder, and can be edited for any file location.

**Important: for the next three weeks, every time you open up RStudio, the first thing you should do is set your working directory to the Moneyball folder.**

## Base R
Now that we have set our working directory, we can work with data. The basic functionality included with R is called Base R. Simple arithmetic such as `2*3` and `mean(3:9)` are included as initial functionality in base R. We can also assign values to vectors and plot graphs.

```{r}
x <- 1:8
y <- c(5,7,8,10,14,15,18,20)
plot(x,y)
```
In the above code, we assigned the numbers 1-8 to x and assigned the numbers 5, 7, ..., 18, 20 to y. Then we plotted the graph with x and y, as if they were coordinate points.

We did all that with Base R. However, the functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of the computing power available with R. Extra functionality comes from add-ons, or packages, created by developers.

## Packages
So far we have seen only the most basic of R's functionality. 
Arguably, one of the things that makes R so powerful is the ease with which users are able to define their own functions and release them to the public.
As [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) defines them, "[R] packages are fundamental units of reproducible code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data." 
As of June 18, 2020, there are 15,805 packages available from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org). 
The scope of these packages is vast: there are some designed for scraping data from the web, pre-processing data to get it into an analyzable format, performing standard and specialized statistical analyses, and to publish your results.
People have also released packages tailored to very specific applications like analyzing baseball data.
There are also some more whimsical packages, like one that allow you to display your favorite [XKCD](https://xkcd.com) comic strip! 

We can install packages in several ways:  

1. In the top toolbar, Tools/Install Packages allows us to search and install packages to our library.

2. In the bottom right pane, the Packages tab has an install button. After clicking this button, we can search for and install a package and its dependencies (for now, always leave the 'Install dependencies' box checked).  
3. The code `install.packages("tidyverse")` will install tidyverse, or any other package.

After installing a package, we have to load the package before using it. Again, we have two options for loading a package:  

1. In bottom right pane, the Packages tab allows us to search and scroll for packages. The checkbox to the left of the package name indicates if the package is loaded. By checking that box, we can load the package.  
2. The code `library(tidyverse)` will load tidyverse, or any other package.

## A quick digression: R Scripts

Up to this point, we have been working strictly within the R console, proceeding line-by-line.
In the previous code block, we tried to add three columns to our tbl and the mutate call got a little bit over-whelming.
Imagine trying to add five or six more columns simultaneously!
As our commands become more and more complex, you'll find that using the console can get pretty cramped.
And if you make a mistake in entering your code, you'll get an error and have to start all over again.
Plus, when we start a new session of R Studio, the console is cleared. 
How can we save the commands we typed into R? We do so using an **R Script**. 

An R Script is a file type which R recognizes as storing R commands and is saved as a .R file. 
R Scripts are useful as we can edit our code before sending it to be run in the console. 

We can start a new R Script by clicking on the top left symbol in R Studio and selecting "R Script".

![](figures/lecture1_fig1.png)

The untitled R Script will then appear in the top left hand box of R Studio.

![](figures/lecture1_fig2.png)

In the R Script, type the following:

```{}
2 * 3
x <- 4
sqrt(x)
```


Now our code is just sitting in the R Script. To run the code (that is, evaluate it in the console) we click the "Run" button in the top right of the script. This will run one line of code at a time - whichever line the cursor is on. Place your cursor on the first line and click "Run". Observe how `2 * 3` now appears in the console, as well as the output `6`.

![](figures/lecture1_fig3.png)

If we want to run multiple lines at once, we highlight them all and click "Run".

![](figures/lecture1_fig4.png)

Note in the above that we had to run `x <- 4` before `sqrt(x)`. We need to define our variables first and run this code in the console before performing calculations with those variables. The console can't "see" the script unless you run the code in the script. 

One very nice thing about RStudio's script editor is that it will highlight syntax errors with a red squiggly line and a red cross in the sidebar.
If you move your mouse over the line, a pop-up will appear that can help you diagnose the potential problem.

Another advantage of R scripts is that you can add comments to your code, which are preceded by the pound sign / hash sign #. 
Comments are useful because they allow you to explain what your code is doing.
**Throughout the rest of this course, we will be working almost exclusively with R scripts rather than directly entering commands into the console.** For the sake of organization, you should save all of your scripts into the 'scripts' folder we created within the 'Moneyball' working directory.


## The tidyverse  
For the rest of the course, we will be working within the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which consists of several R packages for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. 
They are all based on a common design philosophy, mostly developed by Hadley Wickham (whose name you will encounter a lot as you gain more experience with R). 

To access tidyverse, first we first need to install the tidyverse package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
The `install.packages()` function is one way of installing packages in R. You can also use Tools/Install Packages or click on the Packages tab in the bottom right pane of your RStudio view and then click on Install to type in the package you want to install.


Now with the `tidyverse` suite of packages installed, we can load them with the following code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
When you do that, you'll see a lot of output to the console, most of which you can safely ignore for now.
**Note you only need to install the package once. However, each time you open up a new R session and want to use the tidyverse, you will need to run line** `library(tidyverse)` **at the start.**

## Reading in tabular data

Almost all of the data we will encounter in this course (and in the real world) will be tabular.
Each row will represent a separate observation and each column will record a particular measurement.
For instance, the table below lists different statistics for several basketball players from the 2015-16 NBA regular season.
The statistics are:
* field goal makes (FGM)
* field goal attempts (FGA)
* three point makes (TPM)
* three point attempts (TPA)
* free throw makes (FTM)
* free throw attempts (FTA)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my.data <- data.frame("PLAYER" = c("Stephen Curry", "John Wall", "Jimmy Butler", "James Harden", "Kevin Durant", "LeBron James", "Kristaps Porzingis", "Dirk Nowitzki", "Tim Duncan", "Andre Drummond"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

my.data <- data.frame("PLAYER" = c("Stephen Curry", "Damian Lillard", "Jimmy Butler", "James Harden", "Kevin Durant", "LeBron James", "Dirk Nowitzki", "Giannis Antetokounmpo", "DeMarcus Cousins", "Marc Gasol"),
                      "SEASON" = rep("2016", times = 10),
                      "FGM" = c(805, 618, 470, 710, 698, 737, 498, 513, 601, 328),
                      "FGA" = c(1597, 1474, 1034, 1617, 1381, 1416, 1112, 1013, 1332, 707),
                      "TPM" = c(402, 229, 64, 236, 186, 87, 126, 28, 70, 2),
                      "TPA" = c(887, 610, 206, 657, 480, 282, 342, 110, 210, 3),
                      "FTM" = c(363, 414, 395, 720, 447, 359, 250, 296, 476, 203),
                      "FTA" = c(400, 464, 475, 837, 498, 491, 280, 409, 663, 245))

my.data %>% knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

Within the tidyverse, the standard way to store and manipulate tabular data like this is to use what is known as a tbl (pronounced "tibble").
At a high-level, a tbl is a two-dimensional array whose columns can be of different data types.
That is, the first column might be characters (e.g. the names of athletes) and the second column can be numeric (e.g. the number of points scored).

Throughout the course, you will be downloading all datasets we will analyze to your "data" folder within your working directory (the "Moneyball" folder). All of these datasets are in the form of [comma-separated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files, which have extension '.csv'.

Within the tidyverse, we can use the function `read_csv()` to read in a csv file that is stored on your computer and create a tibble containing all of the data.
The dataset showed above is stored in a csv file named "nba_shooting_small.csv" in the "data" folder of our working directory.
We will read it into R with the `read_csv()` function like so:
```{r}
nba_shooting_small <- read_csv(file = "data/nba_shooting_small.csv")
```

Before proceeding, let us parse the syntax `nba_shooting_small <- read_csv(...)`
The first thing to notice is that we're using the assignment operator that we saw in [Problem Set 0](ps0.html).
This tells R that we want it to evalaute whatever is on the right-hand side (in this case `read_csv(file = "data/nba_shooting_small.csv")`) and assign the resulting evaluation to a new object called `nba_shooting_small` (which R will create).
We called the function `read_csv()` with one argument `file`.
This argument is the *relative path* of the CSV file that we want to read into R.
Basically, R starts in the working directory and first looks for a folder called "data."
If it finds such a folder, it looks inside it for a file called "nba_shooting_small.csv."
If it finds the file, it creates a tbl called `nba_shooting_small` that contains all of the data.

When we type in the command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd>, we see some output printed to the console.
This is `read_csv` telling us that it (a) found the file, (b) read it in successfully, and (c) identified the type of data stored in each column.
We see, for instance, that the column named "PLAYER" contains *character strings*, and is parsed as `col_character()`.
Similarly, the number of field goals made ("FGM") is parsed as integer data.

When we print out our tbl, R outputs many things: the dimension (in this case, $10 \times 8$), the column names, the *type* of data included in each column, and then the actual data.

```{r}
nba_shooting_small
```

## Wrangling Data

Now that we have read in our dataset, we're ready to begin our analysis.
Very often, our analysis will involve some type of manipulation or *wrangling* of the data contained in the tbl.
For instance, we may want to compute some new summary statistic based on the data in the table.
In our NBA example, we could compute, say, each player's field goal percentage.
Alternatively, we could subset our data to find all players who took at least 100 three point shots and made at least 80% of their free throws.
The package `dplyr()` contains five main functions corresponding to the most common things that you'll end up doing to your data.
Over the next two days, we will learn each of these

- Reorder the rows with `arrange()`
- Creating new variables that are functions of existing variables with `mutate()`
- Identify observations satisfying certain conditions with `filter()`
- Picking a subset of variables by names with `select()`
- Generating simple summaries of the data with `summarise()`

### Arranging Data
The `arrange()` function works by taking a tbl and a set of column names and sorting the data according to the values in these columns.

```{r}
arrange(nba_shooting_small, FGA)
```
The code above takes our tbl and sorts the rows in ascending order of FGA.
We see that Marc Gasol took the fewest number of field goals (707) while James Harden and Stephen Curry attempted more than twice as many.
We could also sort the players in descending order using `desc()`:
```{r}
arrange(nba_shooting_small, desc(FGA))
```

In this small dataset, no two players attempted the same number of field goals.
In larger datasets (like the one you'll see in [Problem Set1](ps1.html)), it can be the case that there are multiple rows with the same value in a given column.
When arranging the rows of a tbl, to break ties, we can specify more than column.
For instance, the code below sorts the players first by the number of field goal attempts and then by the number of three point attempts.
```{r}
arrange(nba_shooting_small, FGA, TPA)
```

Now consider the two lines of code:
```{r}
arrange(nba_shooting_small, PLAYER)
nba_shooting_small
```
In the first line, we've sorted the players in alphabet order of their first name.
But when we print out our tbl, `nba_shooting_small`, we see that the players are no longer sorted.
This is because dplyr (and most other R) functions **never** modify their input but work by creating a copy and modifying that copy.
If we wanted to preserve the new ordering, we would have to *overwrite* `nba_shooting_small` using a combination of the assignment operator and `arrange()`.
```{r}
nba_shooting_small <- arrange(nba_shooting_small, PLAYER)
nba_shooting_small
```

### Creating new variables from old

While arranging our data is useful, it is not quite sufficient to determine which player is the best shooter in our dataset.
Perhaps the simplest way to compare players' shooting ability is with field goal percentage (FGP).
We can compute this percentage using the formula $\text{FGP} = \frac{\text{FGM}}{\text{FGA}}.$
We use the function `mutate()` to add a column to our tbl.
```{r}
mutate(nba_shooting_small, FGP = FGM/FGA)
```

The syntax for `mutate()` looks kind of similar to `arrange()`: the first argument tells R what tbl we want to manipulate and the second argument tells R how to compute FGP.
As expected, when we run this command, R returns a tbl with a new column containing the field goal percentage for each of these 10 players.
Just like with `arrange()`, if we call `mutate()` by itself, R will not add the new column to our existing data frame.
In order to permanently add a column for field goal percentages to `nba_shooting_small`, we're going to need to use the assignment operator.

It turns out that we can add *multiple* columns to a tbl at once by passing more arguments to `mutate()`, one for each column we wish to define.
```{r}
mutate(nba_shooting_small, FGP = FGM/FGA, TPP = TPM/TPA, FTP = FTM/FTA)
```

## Back to the NBA data

One huge advantage with working with R script is the ability to separate commands onto multiple lines.
For instance, to add columns for FGP, FTP, and TPP to our tbl, we can write the following in our script window.
```{r}
nba_shooting_small <-
  mutate(nba_shooting_small,
         FGP = FGM/FGA,
         TPP = TPM/TPA,
         FTP = FTM/FTA)
```
Notice how we have separated our command into multiple lines.
This makes our script much easier to read.
While it seems a bit cumbersome to write our code like this now, it will make our code much easier to read when we start to string multiple manipulations together using the pipe operator `%>%`, which we will meet in Lecture 3.
